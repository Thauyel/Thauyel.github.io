## Welcome to My Portfolio's Home on GitHub 🏡

**Hi there!** 👋

This is where my architectural journey meets the web. This repository hosts the files for my portfolio website, showcasing my academic projects and design explorations.

While this page holds the code, the real magic happens on the website itself. I invite you to explore my sketches, models, and renderings via the link below.

Thanks for stopping by!
